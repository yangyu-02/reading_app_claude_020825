# TICKET-009: Create Epic Summary and Update Status

## Objective
Create a comprehensive summary of Epic 01 (MVP Foundation) accomplishments and update the project status documentation to reflect the current state of the application.

## Tasks
1. Create a summary of all completed work in Epic 01
2. Create/update current_status.md in the llm_context folder
3. Update claude.md to reflect the development workflow

## Epic 01 Summary

### Completed Tickets
1. **TICKET-001**: Proposed monorepo structure with clear separation of frontend/backend
2. **TICKET-002**: Defined frontend tech stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind)
3. **TICKET-003**: Defined backend tech stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Dramatiq)
4. **TICKET-005**: Created Dockerfiles for backend services and workers
5. **TICKET-006**: Set up frontend development commands with pnpm
6. **TICKET-007**: Created docker-compose.yml for local development orchestration
7. **TICKET-008**: Created Makefile for streamlined development workflows

### Key Achievements
- **Monorepo Structure**: Established clean project organization with separate frontend/backend directories
- **Technology Stack**: Selected modern, performant technologies for both frontend and backend
- **Containerization**: Full Docker support for all backend services
- **Development Tools**: Comprehensive Makefile and pnpm scripts for common tasks
- **Service Architecture**: Integrated PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Dramatiq workers

### Current Status Document

## llm_context/current_status.md
```markdown
# Reading App - Current Status

## Project Overview
A modern web application for reading and managing digital content, built with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

## Current Phase: MVP Foundation (Epic 01) - COMPLETED

### Completed Setup
- ✅ Monorepo structure established
- ✅ Frontend technology stack defined (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- ✅ Backend technology stack defined (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)
- ✅ Docker configuration for all services
- ✅ Development workflow tools (Makefile, pnpm scripts)

### Project Structure
```
reading-app/
├── frontend/          # React application
├── backend/           # FastAPI application
├── docker/            # Docker configurations
├── bin/              # Development scripts
├── docker-compose.yml # Service orchestration
├── Makefile          # Development commands
└── llm_context/      # AI development context
```

### Available Services
- **Frontend**: React dev server (port 5173)
- **Backend API**: FastAPI application (port 8000)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database (port 5432)
- **Redis**: Caching and sessions (port 6379)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker (port 5672, management UI 15672)
- **Dramatiq Workers**: Background task processing

### Quick Start
```bash
# Initial setup
make setup

# Start development
make dev

# Run all checks
make check
```

## Next Steps (Epic 02)
- [ ] Implement user authentication system
- [ ] Create basic UI layout and navigation
- [ ] Set up API endpoints structure
- [ ] Configure database models
- [ ] Implement file upload capabilities

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all frontend code
- Follow FastAPI best practices for API design
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Keep documentation updated
```

### Claude.md Updates

## Updates for llm_context/claude.md
```markdown
## Development Workflow

### Starting a New Feature
1. Review current_status.md to understand the project state
2. Check existing tickets in llm_context/implementation/*/tickets/
3. Use the established project structure
4. Follow the technology choices already made

### Common Commands
- `make dev` - Start full development environment
- `make check` - Run all quality checks
- `make db-migrate` - Apply database migrations
- `make docker-logs` - View service logs

### Project Conventions
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Tailwind for styling
- Backend: FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy
- Testing: Pytest for backend, Vitest for frontend
- Task Queue: Dramatiq with RabbitMQ
- Code Style: Black/Ruff for Python, Prettier for TypeScript

### File Locations
- API endpoints: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
- React components: `frontend/src/components/`
- Database models: `backend/app/db/models/`
- Background tasks: `backend/app/workers/tasks.py`

### When Making Changes
1. Always check current_status.md first
2. Use appropriate Makefile commands
3. Follow existing code patterns
4. Update tests if modifying functionality
5. Run `make check` before completing work
```

## Implementation Notes
- The current_status.md file serves as a living document of project state
- Claude.md additions help maintain consistency across AI-assisted sessions
- Both files should be updated as new epics are completed
- This documentation structure supports efficient handoffs between development sessions
